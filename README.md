# Minishell | NORMED

This project is a program that simulates the behavior of a bash shell, encompassing various features including pipes, redirections, and other core functionalities of the Bash command-line interpreter.

## Project Overview

The Bash Simulator aims to replicate the functionalities of the Bash shell, providing users with an environment to execute commands, manage processes, and manipulate file streams using various Bash-like features.

### Key Features

- **Command Execution**: Execute commands as in a standard bash shell.
- **Redirections**: Support for input and output redirections (`<`, `>`, `>>`).

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the program using make
3. Run ./minishell executable to start the simulated bash environment.
